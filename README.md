#  Employee Workforce Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of an anonymized employee dataset. The project explores key workforce dynamics such as retention patterns, diversity, compensation structures, and attrition trends. Using Python‚Äôs data analysis libraries, we derived actionable insights that can help organizations make data-driven HR decisions.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes employee demographic and employment-related information. It has been anonymized to protect individual privacy.

### **Columns**

* **Education**: Educational qualification (Bachelors, Masters, PhD).
* **Joining Year**: Year the employee joined the company.
* **City**: Employee‚Äôs work location.
* **Payment Tier**: Salary classification.

##  Objectives

This project aims to answer key HR and workforce questions:

1. What is the distribution of educational qualifications among employees?
2. How does length of service vary across cities?
3. Are there correlations between payment tier and domain experience?
4. What is the gender distribution in the workforce?
5. Are there identifiable patterns in employee attrition?

* **Experience Correlation**: Minimal correlation (-0.03) between domain experience and leaving.

These findings highlight important areas for improving workforce engagement and retention.
